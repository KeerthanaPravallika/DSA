/*
Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are an anagram of each other.

Example 1:

Input:
a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have same
characters with same frequency. So, 
both are anagrams.

class Solution
{    
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        if(a.length() != b.length())
            return false;
        char[] arr1 = a.toCharArray();
        char[] arr2 = b.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(arr1);
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<arr1.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr1[i] != arr2[i])
                return false;
